This project evaluates the effectiveness of workplace mental health support programs (MHSPs) on employee performance, job satisfaction, and retention across industries.  
Using a stratified sampling design and statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, proportion tests, and ANOVA), the study assesses overall program impact, compares intervention components, and examines demographic heterogeneity in outcomes.
